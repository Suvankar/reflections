How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This helped me quickly see the changes made by me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

This can help to play with my code without any worries.

git log --stat
git init
git status
git diff
git diff --staged
git checkout master
git brach
git checkout sub-branch
git show
git branch -d coin
git show commitId
git checkout master then git merge master branch
